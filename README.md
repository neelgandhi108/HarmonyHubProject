The Pitch (P1)

College students, particularly at Dartmouth, often face numerous responsibilities, events, and activities that can be overwhelming and demanding. Finding a balance between physical wellness, mental wellness, and career or academic needs is a common challenge. The proposed solution is a holistic approach that helps students achieve a balanced lifestyle during their college years. This project aims to create a platform that tracks students' physical well-being, mental well-being, and career or academic needs, reducing stress and promoting a calm, productive daily flow. The pitch video will showcase a day in the life of a Dartmouth student, highlighting the various aspects of their routine, including physical activities, counseling services, and career or academic resources. The video will emphasize the need for a comprehensive tool that allows students to efficiently manage their well-being and commitments, leading to a more balanced and enjoyable college experience. 

User Research (P2)

This project milestone block focused on needfinding through user research to gather key insights and understand the problem space for developing a product. The team conducted interviews with six individuals from diverse backgrounds and used an empathy map method to unpack the data. The key insights and inferences identified the importance of time-tracking and scheduling, the challenges of balancing self-care activities, and the need for positive reinforcement. The team outlined five user point-of-view statements and ten "How might we" statements based on the interviews. The needs learned through the interviews included the challenges of handling unexpected disruptions to a schedule. The user research process provided valuable insights that will guide the team in developing a product that meets the needs of their users. 

Ideate, Lo-Fi Prototype & Test(P3)

Drawing from the insights gained through our prior user research, we developed an affinity map to categorize the problems experienced by our users. Subsequently, we identified three potential app concepts and produced individual low-fidelity prototypes to evaluate each one. In order to gauge the competitiveness of our product within the market, we conducted additional research to compare our prototypes with existing solutions.

After analyzing the outcomes of our user research, we generated low-fidelity prototypes that were user-friendly and easy to navigate. The primary objective of the prototypes was to provide students with a means of organizing their schedules by integrating Canvas and Google Calendar, while also including gamification components to encourage engagement and motivate them to remain on track with their daily activities.

As we progressed through the low-fidelity design phase, we utilized Figma to create our prototype, incorporating user feedback and refining the aesthetic design. We also included interactive workflows to increase the app's appeal and ease of use.

Interactive Medium-Fi Prototype(P4)

Our mid-fidelity prototype demonstrates significant improvements over the low-fidelity version by offering an improved user flow for setting up applications, planning tasks, and tracking daily productivity. You can find the prototype's highlights below or by clicking the provided link.

To clarify, our low-fidelity prototypes served as basic representations of the product's essential functionalities and user interface. Once we received validation for the initial prototype, we developed a higher-fidelity version that included additional task flow steps and incorporated colours and graphics to enhance the product's aesthetics and engagement.

Our primary objective with the mid-fidelity prototype was to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for our target audience. As we continue to refine our design, we aim to further optimize the product's functionality and user experience.Final Prototype

Final Prototype(P5)

In this milestone of the CS 67/267 project, we successfully revised our prototype based on a heuristic evaluation, rectifying issues of various severities and improving overall usability. Two distinct user flows were refined in the React Native app: the initial setup process and the appearance setting. The setup process was enhanced by implementing a help page, a back button during setup, better Google Calendar integration, and improved system status visibility. The appearance setting was simplified, made more intuitive, and provided users with personalization options, making the app more user-friendly. Despite challenges, these changes have notably enhanced the user experience.
